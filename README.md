        # GET '/api/posts/:post_id/relationships/author' -> to('api-posts#get_related_author')
        # POST '/api/posts/:post_id/relationships/author' -> to('api-posts#post_related_author')

        # If you're in development mode (e.g. MOJO_MODE eq 'development'), your $app->log will show the created routes. Useful!

        # You can use the following helpers too:

        $self->resource_document($dbic_row, $options);

        $self->compound_resource_document($dbic_row, $options);

        $self->resource_documents($dbic_resultset, $options);
    }

# DESCRIPTION

This module intends to supply the user with helper methods that can be used to build a JSON API
compliant API using Mojolicious. It helps create routes for your resources that conform with the
specification, along with supplying helper methods to use when responding to requests.

See [http://jsonapi.org/](http://jsonapi.org/) for the JSON API specification. At the time of writing, the version was 1.0.

# OPTIONS

- `namespace`

    The prefix that's added to all routes, defaults to 'api'. You can also provided an empty string as the namespace,
    meaning no prefix will be added.

- `kebab_case_attrs`

    This is passed to the constructor of `JSONAPI::Document` which will kebab case the attribute keys of each
    record (i.e. '\_' to '-').

# HELPERS

## resource\_routes(_HashRef_ $spec)

Creates a set of routes for the given resource. `$spec` is a hash reference that can consist of the following:

    {
        resource        => 'post', # name of resource, required
        controller      => 'api-posts', # name of controller, defaults to "api-{resource_plural}"
        relationships   => ['author', 'comments'], # default is []
        http_verbs      => ['get', 'post'], # default is ['get', 'post', 'patch', 'delete']
    }

- `resource _Str_`

    The resources name. Should be a singular noun, which will be turned into it's pluralised
    version (e.g. "post" -> "posts") automatically where necessary.

- `controller _Str_`

    The controller name where the actions are to be stored. Defaults to `api-{resource}`, where
    resource is in its pluralised form.

    Routes will point to controller actions, the names of which follow the pattern `{http_method}_{resource}`, with
    dashes replaced with underscores (i.e. 'email-templates' -> 'email\_templates').

- `router _Mojolicious::Routes_`

    The parent route to use for the resource. Optional.

    Provide your own router if you plan to use [under](http://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Mojolicious/Routes/Route#under)
    for your resource.

    **NOTE**: Providing your own router assumes that the router is under the same namespace already, so the resource
    routes won't specify the namespace themselves.

    Usage:

        my $under_api = $r->under('/api')->to('OAuth#is_authenticated');
        $self->resource_routes({
            router => $under_api,
            resource => 'post',
        });

- `relationships _ArrayRef_`

    The relationships belonging to the resource. Defaults to an empty array ref.

    Specifying `relationships` will create additional routes that fall under the resource. These
    can then be used to reference [self](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-relationships)
    _or_ [related](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-related-resource-links) routes, as
    both will point to the same controller action i.e. `/api/posts/1/relationships/author` and
    `/api/posts/1/author` will go to `Api::Posts::{http_method}_related_author`. This is because in my
    opinion they're different routes with the same purpose, which is to action on the related resource.

    **NOTE**: Your relationships should be in the correct form (singular/plural) based on the relationship in your
    schema management system. For example, if you have a resource called 'post' and it has many 'comments', make
    sure comments is passed in as a plural noun here.

- `http_verbs _ArrayRef_`

    The HTTP verbs/methods to use when creating the resources routes. Defaults to `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`, where
    `GET` is both for the collection route as well as the single resource route (e.g. `/api/authors` and `/api/authors/:author_id`).

    Specifying this will not, if provided, affect the relationship routes that will be created. Those will have routes created for
    all verbs regardless.

## render\_error(_Str_ $status, _ArrayRef|Str_ $errors, _HashRef_ $meta?)

Renders a JSON response under the required top-level `errors` key. `errors` should be an array reference of error objects
as described in the specification, or a string that will be the content of _title_.
See [Error Objects](http://jsonapi.org/format/#error-objects).

Can optionally provide meta information, which will be added to the response as-is.

## requested\_resources

Convenience helper for controllers. Takes the query param `include`, used to indicate what relationships to include in the
response, and splits it by ',' to return an ArrayRef.

    GET /api/posts?include=comments,author
    my $include = $c->requested_resources(); # ['comments', 'author']

Can also include nested relationships:

    GET /api/posts?include=comments,author.notes
    my $include = $c->requested_resources(); # ['comments', { author => ['notes'] }]

**NOTE**: Only one level of nesting is supported at the moment, so requests like `author.notes.notes_relation` won't
give back what you expect. Stick with `author.notes` and lazy loading `notes_relation`.

## requested\_fields

Takes each query param `fields[TYPE]` and creates a HashRef containing all its requested fields along with
any relationship fields. This is useful if you only want to return a subset of attributes for a resource.

The HashRef produced is suitable to pass directly to the options of `JSONAPI::Document::resource_document`.

Included fields should be direct attributes of the resource, not its relationships. See `requested_resources`
for that use case.

The main resource should be in the plural form inside the param (i.e. 'posts', not 'post'), and related resources
in their correct form.

    GET /api/posts?fields[posts]=slug,title&fields[comments]=likes&fields[author]=name,email

    my $fields = $c->requested_fields();

    # Out:
    {
       fields => ['slug', 'title'],
       related_fields => {
           comments => ['likes'],
           author => ['name', 'email']
       }
    }

## resource\_document

Available in controllers:

    $c->resource_document($dbix_row, $options);

See [resource\_document](https://metacpan.org/pod/JSONAPI::Document#resource_document\(DBIx::Class::Row-$row,-HashRef-$options\)) for usage.

## compound\_resource\_document

Available in controllers:

    $c->compound_resource_document($dbix_row, $options);

See [compound\_resource\_document](https://metacpan.org/pod/JSONAPI::Document#compound_resource_document\(DBIx::Class::Row-$row,-HashRef-$options\)) for usage.

## resource\_documents

Available in controllers:

    $c->resource_documents($dbix_resultset, $options);

See [resource\_documents](https://metacpan.org/pod/JSONAPI::Document#resource_documents\(DBIx::Class::Row-$row,-HashRef-$options\)) for usage.

# TODO

- Allow specifying `http_verbs` in the `resource_routes` helper for relationships.
